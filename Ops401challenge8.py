# Author:                        Alex Wise
# Date of latest revision:       01/25/2023
# Purpose:                       Encrption part 3


# task
    #  create a script that utilizes the cryptography library to:
        # Prompt the user to select a mode
            # Encrypt a file (mode 1)
            # Decrypt a file (mode 2) 
            # Encrypt a message (mode 3)
            # Decrypt a message (mode 4)
                
                # Part 2
                # Recursively encrypt a single folder and all its contents
                # Recursively decrypt a single folder that was encrypted by this tool

                    # Part 3
                    # Alter the desktop wallpaper on a Windows PC with a ransomware message
                    # Create a popup window on a Windows PC with a ransomware message
                    # Stretch- Add additional features that draw the computer userâ€™s attention to the ransomware message.
